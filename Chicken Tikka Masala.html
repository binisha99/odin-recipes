        Ingredients
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup teriyaki sauce</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup lemon juice</li>

    <h2>
        Steps
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Whisk teriyaki sauce, lemon juice, garlic, and sesame oil together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to overnight, turning every so often.
        </li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ul>
